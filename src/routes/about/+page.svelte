		<p class ="p">
      I am currently a senior at the University of South Carolina Aiken majoring in Computer Science. My main goal is to become a full-time Software Engineer! 
      I enjoy developing mostly in the back-end side of software development. I am proficient in Javascript, Golang, and Java. 
      Outside of coding, I really like drinking a nice caramel latte and read philosophy books.
